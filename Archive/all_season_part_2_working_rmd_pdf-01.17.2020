# All Seasons Portfolio Part 2

My third post to connect my learnings with my personal passion.


# Business Science Problem Framework (BSPF)

- With the increasing array of tools, I was swept away into some meaningless directions between advanced algorithms and other statistics. Therefofare I sat myself down to use a streamlined framework called the BSPF to re-orient myself. The BSPF is a systematic process to apply data science to business built on the learnings of Ray Dalio's philosophies in the book, Principles and Crisp DM

1. How To Successfully Manage A Data Science Project: The Business Science Problem Framework from Matt Dancho's Business Science University (https://www.business-science.io/business/2018/06/19/business-science-problem-framework.html)
```{r, out.width = "1000px", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Business Science Problem Framework"}
#PICTURES: Showcasing the picture of the book and the course
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Business Science Framework - V2.JPG")
```


2. Principles by Ray Dalio (https://www.principles.com/)

```{r, out.width = "200px", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Principles"}

#PICTURES: Showcasing the picture of the book and the course
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Principles Ray Dalio.jpg")

```


3. Reading the wealth of articles on Reproducible Finance with R: Code Flows and Shiny Apps for Portfolio Analysis by Jonathan K. Regenstein (http://www.reproduciblefinance.com/)
```{r, out.width = "200px", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Reproducible Finance with R: Code Flows and Shiny Apps for Portfolio Analysis"}

#PICTURES: Showcasing the picture of the book and the course
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Reproducible Finance with R.jpg")

```

_Credits go to both Matt Dancho and Jonathan K Regenstein in making this post possible. Matt for educating me and creating the tidyquant package and Jonathan for putting together a book for beginners._

# Business Understanding

## Developing a Portfolio based on Ray Dalio's All Weather Fund

In Tony Robbin's book - Master the Game, I learned about the All Weather Fund and more about personal investing for the general public. Since then I decided to complete a deeper dive on this portfolio and the different asset classes to determine if data science can help me to unlock some more financial benefits. 

__Objective and Key Result__

- __Objective:__ Optimize an investment portfolio based on Ray Dalio's All Weather Fund

- __Hypothesis and Key Result:__ An asset weighting with better return per unit of risk exists beyond what Ray Dalio has prescribed  


## Breakdown of All Weather Fund

1. 40% Long Term Bonds (TLT)
2. 30% Stocks (VTI)
3. 15% Intermediate Term Bonds (IEF)
4. 7.5% Gold (GLD)
5. 7.5% Commodities (DBC)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#3.0 BUILDING A PORTFOLIO ----
w <- c(0.3,
       0.4,
       0.15,
       0.075,
       0.075)
symbols <- c("VTI", "TLT", "IEF", "GLD", "DBC")
wts_tbl <- tibble(symbols, w)


# wts_tbl %>% 
#     ggplot(aes(x = "", y = w, fill = symbols)) + 
#     geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") + 
#     coord_polar("y", start = 0) + 
#     theme(axis.text.x = element_blank()) +
#     geom_text(label = scales::percent(w), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
#     scale_fill_tq() + 
#     labs(x = "", y = "", fill = "",
#          title = "Asset weights in portfolio"
#          # caption = "Ray Dalio's All Weather Fund"
#          )
